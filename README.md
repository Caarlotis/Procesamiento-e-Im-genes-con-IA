**Biomedical Image Processing and AI-based Analysis**
This repository contains notebooks worked during the Biomedical Image Processing based on AI course.
They cover fundamental tasks on image processing such as mage reading, conversion to grayscale, thresholding, mathematical morphology, object detection, and measurement.
Both the object detection model notebook and the emotion recognition notebook also dive into dataset preparation, model training and testing and evaluation.
